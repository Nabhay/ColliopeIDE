# Calliope IDE - AI-Powered Chat Application for Smart Contract Development

Calliope IDE is a modern, browser-based AI coding assistant specifically designed to simplify Soroban smart contract development. Unlike traditional IDEs that require complex setup and local installations, Calliope IDE runs entirely in your browser, providing an intuitive chat interface for writing, testing, and deploying Soroban contracts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18.x or later
- **Python**: 3.8 or later
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aludyalu/chatterji.git
    cd chatterji
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install flask google-generativeai
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (optional but recommended for Next.js) or export variables directly:
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
    ```

### Running Locally

1.  **Start the Backend**:
    ```bash
    python3 server/start.py
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend** (in a new terminal):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Access the IDE**:
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)
The easiest way to deploy the Next.js frontend is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new).
1. Push your code to a Git repository.
2. Import the project into Vercel.
3. Add necessary environment variables.

### Backend
The Python/Flask backend needs a persistent server environment (unlike Vercel's serverless functions which have timeouts).
- **Recommended**: Railway, Render, or a VPS (DigitalOcean/AWS).
- Ensure the backend URL is correctly configured in the frontend (you may need to update `pages/app/index.jsx` or use an environment variable for the API URL).
